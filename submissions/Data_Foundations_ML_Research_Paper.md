# Daily Study Habits and Academic Performance: A Self-Collected Dataset for Machine Learning

 Abstract

This study presents the relationship between daily student habits and academic performance. 
the dataset contains 50 samples and includes numerical and categorical
variables such as study time, sleep duration, phone usage, attendance,
and internet access. Real-world data quality issues such as missing
values and class imbalance are intentionally preserved to support data
preprocessing and Machine Learning experimentation.

 1. Introduction and Collection Method
Educational performance is influenced by behavioral and environmental
factors. This dataset was collected through surveys and manual
observation from 50 students in a local educational environment.
Participants self-reported their daily habits over one week. The data
was manually recorded, resulting in realistic imperfections commonly
found in real-world datasets.

 2. Features and Label Description

The dataset consists of six input features: Age, Study Hours, Sleep
Hours, Phone Usage Hours, Attendance level, and Internet Access. The
output variable (label) is Final Grade categorized as A, B, C, D, or F.
These variables allow the dataset to be used for supervised and
unsupervised Machine Learning tasks.

 3. Dataset Structure

The dataset contains 50 rows and 7 columns. Six columns represent
features while one column represents the label. The dataset includes
numerical and categorical data, along with missing values that must be
handled during preprocessing.

4. Data Quality Issues

Several data quality issues exist in the dataset, including missing
values, inconsistent categorical formatting, class imbalance among
grades, and self-reporting bias. These challenges make the dataset
appropriate for learning data cleaning, encoding, normalization, and
imbalance handling techniques.

 5. Machine Learning Use Cases

The dataset can be used for classification to predict student grades,
regression by mapping grades to numerical values, and clustering to
group students based on behavior patterns. It also supports educational
decision-making and early risk detection systems.

 6. Conclusion

This  dataset provides a strong foundation for Machine
Learning education. Its realistic structure and imperfections reflect
real-world data challenges, making it suitable for teaching
preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development.
