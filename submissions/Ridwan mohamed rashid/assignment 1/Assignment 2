### Title

**A Survey-Based Dataset on University Students’ Study Habits and Academic Performance**

## 1. Dataset Title & Collection Method

**Dataset Title:**
Student Study Habits and Performance Dataset

**Collection Method:**
This dataset was collected using a **manual survey** conducted among university students. A simple questionnaire was shared with students, and their responses were recorded manually in a spreadsheet. The survey focused on daily study habits, attendance, sleep patterns, and academic performance.

A total of **50 students** participated in the survey. No pre-made datasets were used; all data was collected directly from participants.

## 2. Description of Features & Label

### Input Variables (Features – X):

1. **Age** – Age of the student (years)
2. **Gender** – Male / Female
3. **Study_Hours_Per_Day** – Average hours spent studying per day
4. **Attendance_Percentage** – Class attendance (%)
5. **Sleep_Hours** – Average hours of sleep per night

### Output Variable (Label – y):

* **Final_Grade** – Student’s final exam result (A, B, C, D, F)

This makes the dataset suitable for a **classification problem**, where the goal is to predict a student’s final grade.



## 3. Dataset Structure

* **Number of rows:** 50
* **Number of columns:** 6

### Sample Data (First 7 rows)

| Age | Gender | Study_Hours_Per_Day | Attendance_Percentage | Sleep_Hours | Final_Grade |
| --- | ------ | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 20  | Female | 3.5                 | 85                    | 7           | B           |
| 22  | Male   | 2.0                 | 70                    | 6           | C           |
| 19  | Female | 4.0                 | 90                    | 8           | A           |
| 21  | Male   | 1.5                 | 60                    | 5           | D           |
| 23  | Male   | 5.0                 | 95                    | 7           | A           |
| 20  | Female | 2.5                 | 75                    | 6           | C           |
| 24  | Male   | 3.0                 | 80                    | 7           | B           |

## 4. Data Quality Issues

Several data quality issues were observed:

* **Missing values:** Some students did not report exact study hours or sleep hours.
* **Inconsistent entries:** Attendance percentages were sometimes entered as text (e.g., “eighty”).
* **Class imbalance:** Grades such as A and B appeared more frequently than D or F.
* **Human error:** Since the data was collected manually, minor typos may exist.

These issues will require **data cleaning and preprocessing** before model training.

## 5. Use Case in Machine Learning

This dataset can be used in multiple Machine Learning tasks:

* **Classification:** Predicting the final grade of a student based on study habits and attendance.
* **Regression:** If grades are converted to numerical values, predicting exact performance scores.
* **Clustering:** Grouping students based on similar study behaviors.

Such a model could help educators identify students at risk and improve academic support strategies.

## Conclusion

This dataset represents a real-world data collection experience using surveys. Despite minor quality issues, it provides valuable insights into the relationship between study habits and academic performance and is suitable for Machine Learning experiments such as classification and clustering.
